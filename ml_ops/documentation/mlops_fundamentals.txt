ML Ops Fundamentals: A Beginner's Guide
=====================================

What is ML Ops?
--------------
ML Ops (Machine Learning Operations) is a set of practices that combines Machine Learning, DevOps, and Data Engineering to deploy and maintain ML systems in production reliably and efficiently. It aims to automate and standardize the ML lifecycle, from development to deployment and monitoring.

Key Components of ML Ops
-----------------------
1. Version Control
   - Code versioning (Git)
   - Data versioning (DVC)
   - Model versioning (MLflow)
   - Experiment tracking

2. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
   - Automated testing
   - Model validation
   - Deployment automation
   - Environment management

3. Model Monitoring
   - Performance monitoring
   - Data drift detection
   - Model drift detection
   - System health monitoring

4. Infrastructure Management
   - Containerization (Docker)
   - Orchestration (Kubernetes)
   - Resource management
   - Scaling

5. Data Management
   - Data versioning
   - Feature stores
   - Data pipelines
   - Data quality monitoring

6. Model Management
   - Model registry
   - Model serving
   - A/B testing
   - Model retraining

Best Practices
-------------
1. Development
   - Use version control for all components
   - Implement automated testing
   - Follow coding standards
   - Document code and processes

2. Deployment
   - Containerize applications
   - Use infrastructure as code
   - Implement automated deployment
   - Monitor deployment health

3. Monitoring
   - Track model performance
   - Monitor data quality
   - Set up alerts
   - Maintain logs

4. Maintenance
   - Regular model retraining
   - System updates
   - Performance optimization
   - Security updates
